# Problem statement

Obviously we do love our parents than anyone else becuase they are most beautiful gift to us by god. They have cared for us more than anyone in our childhood days so isn’t our responsibility to do the same in their old age life ? 

But yeah, in a world full of busy schedule we are generally unable to spend some quality time with them. We don’t have enough time to sit by their side and get to know about their health. There are also people who live far away from their homes for jobs or anything else and always curious about their parents, How are they? What about their health? Is everything normal? and things like that.

# Approach to SmarTee(solution to the above problem)
With the vision of overcoming this problem, the idea of SmarTee has been proposed, a smart t-shirt with some built in health sensors that could be able to track our elderly parents health. We can get the status of their health in realtime on the SmarTee’s mobile application. Distance wont be a factor anymore to get to know about your parents health

# Capabilities

SmarTee will be acquired with most of the advanced health sensors and with the advancement of the  project from its initial prototype stage to the final stage, it will keep on updating with the addition of more new features.
The future model has been thought to be designed with capabilities like –
Heart Beat rate Monitoring ( would be able to tell the fluctutaions for determing any issues in the body)
Capable of acquiring ECG signals
Body Temperature monitoring
Stress Monitoring
Breathing Rate
Activity Level
further more additions to be made…
